# ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks!

I'm Corrie, an Full Stack Developer from the US currently in Vietnam! I've been a teacher for 10 years and I've pivoted into remote development roles over the last 2 years. I'm a curious and adventurous person who loves learning about new frameworks and libraries. When I'm not working, I spend most of my time polishing my skills and discovering new tools to add to my ever-expanding toolkit. I'm always striving to become a better developer and produce high-quality work that I can be proud of.

## In brief

- I'm a web developer from the US
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate!
- I'm looking for the perfect OSS to call home
