# ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks!

I'm Corrie, a Full Stack Developer from the US! I was a teacher for 10 years and I've been working as a remote devoloper for the past 2 years. I'm a curious and adventurous person who loves learning about new frameworks and libraries. When I'm not working, I spend most of my time busying myself with some side project or hanging out with my wife and 2 cats. I'm always striving to become a better developer and learn new things that, while not always useful, I find interesting.

## In brief

- I'm a web developer from the US
- Iâ€™m a lifelong student
- I'm somewhat of a homebody (when I'm not hiking)
