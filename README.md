# ðŸ‘‹ Hola!

I'm Corrie, a software engineer currently focusing on Typescript and Dart. I started off in education for about a decade and made the transition to tech -- there's some overlap in the projects I'm working on, so I'm glad to be able to keep that experience relevant. I'm a curious and adventurous person who loves learning about new frameworks and libraries. When I'm not working, I spend most of my time away from the computer reading or hanging out with my wife and 2 cats. 

## In brief

- I'm a software engineer from the US
- Iâ€™m a lifelong student
- I'm somewhat of a homebody (when I'm not hiking)
