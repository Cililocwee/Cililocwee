# ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks!

I'm a frontend developer, based in Vietnam but originally from the United States. I'm a curious and adventurous person who loves learning about new frameworks and libraries. Although my main focus is on the frontend, I've recently dabbled in a few backend projects, which has been a lot of fun. When I'm not working, I spend most of my time polishing my skills and discovering new tools to add to my ever-expanding toolkit. I'm always striving to become a better developer and produce high-quality work that I can be proud of.

## In brief

- I'm a web developer from the US
- Iâ€™m currently spending an intense amount of time on personal projects
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to Javascript or Web Development
